=head1 Perl 6 Internet Sockets Testing
The initial use of the BSD Sockets library by Parrot and Rakudo happened
without a formal test suite, slowing development and causing occasional
random errors. This set of tests aims to ensure the future stability of
of the Sockets library integration, and to help enhance Rakudo's
IO::Socket::INET class in the 'setting'.

The BSD Sockets functions provide server and client functions that run
synchronously, blocking and waiting indefinitely for communication from
a remote process. Sockets testing therefore requires separate server and
client processes or threads. Rakudo does not currently fork or thread,
so these tests employ a unix shell script that uses the & symbol to fork
background processes. When Rakudo starts forking or threading, this
testing solution should be refactored down to just the main script.

=head1 Scope of tests
To date, only single TCP sessions have been tested, and only on Linux.
The Internet standard protocols are used, except that a dynamic port
number above the first 1024 is used so that superuser (root) privileges
are not required. Execution time is 5 to 10 seconds.

=head1 TODO
UDP. Unix sockets. Concurrent connections (needs threads).
