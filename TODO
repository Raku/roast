TODO items for the Perl 6 Test Suite

Add any requested tests or other updates to this file. Please organize them
by synopsis (when applicable) or put them in the OVERALL section at the top
if they apply to the test suite in general.

Please also read t/deprecated-syntax.pod for common mistakes in the test
suite, and clear them when you update tests.

When you are adding entries here, please put something like this in the
commit message:
[t/TASKS]: Added more tasks for S02.
This way, people working on the test suite can easily spot these commits
in #perl6.

This file had entries in the past (r16405). Since this file wasn't touched
in over 4000 commits, I (Auzon) cleared them out.

OVERALL
* Add smartlinks to tests without them
* Continue moving tests from t/ to t/spec/
* Clean up old POD (only present in some testing modules)
* Review XXX entries for test corrections

UPDATING TASKS
sometimes the spec changes, and the test suite must be updated accordingly.
Here's a list of what needs to be done, along with the revisions that changed
the spec (newest first)

* (r26401) Pi/Pf characters are allowed as brackets
* (r26302) limit to IO.lines
* (r26101) :all flag for Str.split
* (r25891) Junction -> junction, eigenstates method is now private
* (r25830) named parameters to open()
* (r25821) bare values in signatures
* (r25774) ~ and + act on the matched string, not the abstract object
* (r25767) updates to builtin regexes
* (r25715) lists in item context autopromote to captures

S02
* tests for KeySet. See spec/S02-builtin_data_types/keyhash.t for inspiration
* tests for Implementation types (the Perl 6 equiv. of tie()), probably need
  more specs as well
* some tests in S02 assume that a floating point literal like 1.2 is of typ
  Rat (rational), but it really is of type Num. Same for things like (1 / 2) 
  (to produce a Rat you need (1 div 2) or (1/2) without spaces). 
  This needs cleanup. Just grep for Rat,
  review the tests and clean them up where appropriate

S03
* tests for cmp() and eqv() methods of objects
* test that '@array, *' repeats the final element infinitely
* tests for feeds using IO objects
* more bitwise tests, for :signed and :unsigned, and uncomment the tests in
  t/spec/S03-operators/bit.t

S04
* test warn()
* more tests for excepts and CATCH blocks
* tests for control exception handlers

S05
* mm//, ss/// variants
* switch some "ok" tests to "is" tests to check the exact match
* modifier tests. It's easy to grep to see which are present
* tests for the "special named assertions"
* more of everything.

S09
* more tests for multidimensional arrays (also .shape, see S29)
* tests for user-defined array indexing
* tests for PDL

S12
* tests for multi *method* dispatch (either write new ones, or find and review
  some under t/oo/)
* tests for $object.WALK
* tests for $object.*@candidates
* tests for "but" (such as 0 but Bool::True; should go into S12-enums/)
* tests for metamethods (under "Introspection" in S12)
* tests for autovivification
* more tests for inheritance. Auzon noticed that there were no multiple inheritance tests, so other important things are bound to be missing.

S16
* tests for glob()
* tests for lines($filehandle) and lines($filename)

S29
* tests for array: shape
* tests for pack and unpack
* tests to ensure that rand has a bit of entropy


IO
* more tests for say() and print(). For example elf prints array references
  as ARRAY(0x8832e28). This might be a bit tricky because we either have to
  capture stdout, or open a pipe to a second script.

SINGLE TESTS
* t/syntax/signature.t is flawed and has a XXX comment of what needs to be done
* t/spec/S04-closure-traits/pre-post.t has an up-to-date TODO list that needs
  implementing

Spec clarification
   These tests contain things that aren't specced, and for which we should
   get clarification - either spec it, or delete the parts of the tests that
   rely on it.
* t/oo/syntax-but.t contains '$value but { closure }', which is mentioned once
  in S02 in a different context, but not anywhere else it seems. Is that
  intentional?
