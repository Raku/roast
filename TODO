TODO items for the Raku Test Suite

Add any requested tests or other updates to this file. Please organize them
by synopsis (when applicable) or put them in the OVERALL section at the top
if they apply to the test suite in general.

NOTE that references to a t/ directory are for the t/ directory in the mu
repository found here:  https://github.com/perl6/mu

Please also read t/deprecated-syntax.pod for common mistakes in the test
suite, and clear them when you update tests.

When you are adding entries here, please put something like this in the
commit message:

[TODO]: Added more tasks for S02.

This way, people working on the test suite can easily spot these commits
in #perl6.

OVERALL
* Add smartlinks to tests without them
* Review XXX entries for test corrections
* Find rakudo fudges that do not reference an RT, "NYI", or "unspecced"
  Open a ticket describing the problem, add that RT number to
  the fudge comment. (other implementations have their own ticketing
  systems)

SPECIFIC
*
