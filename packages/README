t/spec/packages/README

This directory exists to hold files tested in S10-packages so that there isn't
a hyphen in the filename of the .pm file. This way, we can just
    use t::spec::packages::Whatever;
instead of needing to quote the package name all the time, or add the proper
directory to the Perl 6 equivalent of @INC.

*****************************************************************************
** WARNING: This file can be used by some tests as an arbitrary file to read
** arbitrary data from and rely on it being located here, under this name.
** If changing the name or location, ensure all tests still pass.
