# Test::Compile is new and untested.  It is for simple precompilation
# bugs that do not involve the module loader itself, e.g. serialization
# difficulties.  For now, keep all tests that use it in here.

# It should theoretically autoskip tests for compilers that do not have
# full S10/S11 implementations, we'll see

# Please doublecheck after adding tests that no files that look like
# /tmp/p6testmod2CF3839E/p6testmod1406E1E1.pm6 (or windowish equiv)
# are left in $*TMPDIR.

# Note that S10-packages/precompilation.t exists for things that involve
# CompUnit or CompUnitRepo or are just too complex for Test::Compile
# A few of the tests in there could eventually be moved here, probably.
